# Design Under PCAM Methodology

## Â¿What is PCAM?

This methodology structures the design process as four distinct stages: partitioning, communication, agglomeration, and   mapping. (The acronym PCAM may serve as a useful reminder of this structure.) In the first two stages, we focus on concurrency and scalability and seek to discover algorithms with these qualities. In the third and fourth stages, attention shifts to locality and other performance-related issues. The four stages are illustrated in Figure 2.1 and can be summarized as follows
